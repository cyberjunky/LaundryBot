ESP8266 based CT Clamp sensor for monitoring washing machine power usage and reporting into HomeAssistant

I've included the STL's to print out my housing for the circuit board that holds the Wemos D1 mini, the display, and the circuit to connect to the CT Clamp.

BILL OF MATERIALS:
1 x Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 
1 x 1.3inch I2C Serial 128x64 SSH1106 OLED LCD Display  
1 x 4 pin female header for solderable protoboard for the display
2 x 8 pin female header for solderable protoboard for the D1 Mini (my board came with these)
2 x 8 pin male headers for the D1 mini (my board came with these and I just had to solder them on)
1 x 30A 0-1V output CT Clamp, e.g. https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MY361ZW
1 x Electrocookie 1/2 size solderable breadboard, or Adafruit 1/2 size protoboard. Both will fit in the case as they have the same 3mm fixing holes.
1 x 90 degree micro USB cable (if you want the power for the D1 mini to exit downwards from the case)

Assorted 22 AWG wires to make jumpers for the solderable protoboard
Assorted heatshrink tube (a) to tidy the wiring loom for the display, and (b) to insulate the soldered joint between the CT Clamp to two pairs of the CAT6 cable used to extend the wiring.

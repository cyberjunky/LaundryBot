Font files need to be uploaded to config/esphome/fonts in your HA instance. 

I'm using:
arial.ttf (pulled from my PC),
materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf (freely available from https://materialdesignicons.com)
BebasNeue-Regular.ttf (free download from https://www.dafont.com/bebas-neue.font)

You'll need to grab these yourself, or change the fonts you're using in the laundrybot.yaml to suit your preferences

This folder contains the STL files for my housing. 

I've included three lid options 
- a blank lid
- a lid with the LaundryBot! name already in place, raised from the surface by 0.5mm
- a lid with the LaundryBot! name embossed into the surface

I've included the STLs for the letters in LaundryBot! so you can print them in a different colour and then glue them in place in the lid. 

Note that when I imported the "." of the "!" into Cura, it resized it to 1000%. Just resize it's width back to 2.402mm and it'll be fine. (it's 1.5mm tall)
